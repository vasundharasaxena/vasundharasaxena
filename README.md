## Projects

<img align="left" width="260" height="200" src="https://www.sender.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/black-friday-email-templates-1024x658.png"> **[Black Friday Sales Analysis](https://github.com/vasundharasaxena/black-friday-sales)**

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Black Friday sales data, focusing on customer purchasing behavior. Key objectives include identifying patterns and trends in product preferences, customer demographics, and sales performance during the event. Various data visualization techniques were used to reveal insights about product categories, spending habits across age groups, and the influence of discounts. This analysis provides actionable insights for retailers to optimize sales strategies during high-traffic events like Black Friday.

In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict hotel cancellations based on booking details. By analyzing a variety of factors such as lead time, customer type, room type, and special requests, the model helps hotels anticipate cancellations and optimize bookings. I employed techniques such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns in cancellation behavior. The final model, implemented using logistic regression and decision trees, was fine-tuned for accuracy and deployed using Flask for real-time prediction. This solution can assist hotels in improving resource management and reducing revenue loss due to last-minute cancellations.

In this project, I developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The objective was to automate the classification of pneumonia cases by training the model on a labeled dataset of chest radiographs. I employed various deep learning techniques, including image preprocessing, data augmentation, and fine-tuning of the CNN architecture to optimize the model's performance. The final model achieved high accuracy in distinguishing between healthy lungs and pneumonia-infected lungs, providing a tool for assisting radiologists in early detection and treatment. The project was implemented using TensorFlow and Keras libraries, and it emphasizes the potential of AI in healthcare diagnostics.

In this project, I performed a detailed analysis of London‚Äôs bike-sharing data to understand usage patterns across different times and locations. The analysis focuses on uncovering trends in bike ride duration, peak hours of usage, and popular routes. I utilized various data visualization techniques to illustrate the influence of factors such as weather conditions, weekdays versus weekends, and station proximity on bike usage. The insights drawn from this project can help city planners optimize bike-sharing services and improve urban mobility solutions for commuters. The project was built using Python with libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

In this project, I developed a machine learning model to detect bot activity in online platforms by analyzing user behavior patterns. The goal was to differentiate between human and bot-generated activities using features such as click rates, session durations, and interaction sequences. I utilized a range of classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, to build and compare models for bot detection. The model was evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure robust performance. This solution can be applied to social media platforms, e-commerce websites, and online forums to enhance security and mitigate fraudulent activities.

In this project, I developed a deep learning model to detect driver drowsiness in real-time by analyzing facial landmarks and eye movement patterns. The system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on facial images to identify signs of fatigue, such as prolonged eye closures or yawning. By continuously monitoring the driver‚Äôs face, the model triggers an alert when it detects drowsiness, enhancing road safety and preventing accidents. This project leverages OpenCV for real-time video capture, along with TensorFlow for model implementation. The solution can be applied in smart vehicles and driver-assistance systems to ensure safer driving conditions.
